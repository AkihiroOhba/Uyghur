C Extension

  The C extension is crucial for phpcassaÅfs performance.

  You need to configure and make to be able to use the C extension:

  cd src/libs/phpcassa/thrift/ext/thrift_protocol
  phpize
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

  Add the following line to your php.ini file:

  extension=thrift_protocol.so
